"""Outcomes and their probabilities: the annual and the event basis.

The objectives, the premium, the budget and the basis-risk metrics never use
event frequencies directly. They use an :class:`OutcomeMeasure`, which says
which **outcome** each event belongs to and the **probability** of each
outcome. Per-event quantities (for example the uncovered loss
``(L_e - payout_e)^+``) are summed into outcomes and then weighted with the
probabilities.

``N`` is the number of simulation years of the whole hazard set (the
index's ``years``) and ``S`` the years a calculation uses: all of them, or a
training or test block from
:func:`~petals_parametric.index.split_years`.

``"annual"`` (recommended)
    One outcome per simulation year: the events of a year are summed, so
    the uncovered loss of a year is ``U_y = sum_{e in y} (L_e - payout_e)^+``.
    Each year has probability ``1 / |S|``. Every event must have the
    frequency ``1 / N`` (one simulated history of ``N`` years); otherwise
    the year structure and the frequencies disagree, and the measure
    raises. Years without events are outcomes without loss; they are pooled
    into one last outcome with probability ``(number of such years) / |S|``.
    Pooling changes no expectation, quantile or CVaR, because all those
    years have the value 0 for every per-event quantity. ``CVaR_beta`` is
    then the mean of the worst ``1 - beta`` of years: ``beta = 0.99`` is
    the 100-year level and beyond.
``"event"``
    One outcome per event, with probability ``frequency * N / |S|`` (the
    event's annual frequency, re-expressed over the years used), plus one
    "no event" outcome with the remaining probability. The frequencies must
    sum to at most one event per year.
