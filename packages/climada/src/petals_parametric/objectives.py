"""Objectives of a design problem: what the calibration minimises.

With outcome probabilities ``p_o``, outcome loss ``L_o`` and outcome payout
``P_o`` (sums over the events of outcome ``o`` and over the units of the
design problem; see :mod:`~petals_parametric.measure`), and the uncovered
loss ``U_o = sum_{e in o} (L_e - P_e)^+``:

* :class:`ExpectedUncovered`: ``E[U] = sum_o p_o U_o``. Over-payment is
  not rewarded. A linear program (LP).
* :class:`WeightedCVaR`: ``alpha * CVaR_beta(U) + (1 - alpha) * E[U]``:
  **alpha weights the CVaR term**, so ``alpha = 0`` is ``E[U]`` and
  ``alpha = 1`` the CVaR of ``U`` alone. With the Rockafellar-Uryasev form
  of the CVaR it is an LP too. It is a mixture of the mean and the CVaR of
  the uncovered loss, not a CVaR with weights on the outcomes.
* :class:`MeanSquaredError`: ``sum_o p_o (L_o - P_o)^2``, the signed
  residual per outcome, so over-payment counts like under-payment. A
  quadratic program (QP): it needs the optional dependency cvxpy.

The LPs are solved with scipy's HiGHS (:mod:`~petals_parametric.solvers`).
Each class also evaluates its objective for given losses and payouts with
numpy, which is how a solution is checked and how the basis-risk metrics
are computed.

When ``beta`` is at most the probability of the outcomes without loss,
``P(L_o = 0)``, every design has ``VaR_beta(U) = 0`` and the weighted-CVaR
objective is ``(alpha / (1 - beta) + 1 - alpha) * E[U]``: it has the same
minimisers as ``E[U]``. :func:`~petals_parametric.calibrate.calibrate`
records this case as ``degenerate_tail`` and logs a warning.
